    <h3>Var</h3>
        <p>var is used for declare global variable</p>   
    <h3>Let</h3>
        <p>Let is used for declare Local variable</p>
    <h3>Const</h3>
        <p>When any variable is constant then we declare as a constat</p>
    <h3>Difference between var, let and const</h3>
    <p> 1.We can change the var value globally.</br>
        2.If our var name and let var name are same then it's not affect to the global name. </br>
        3.If we change the local variable inside the block then changes happed in inside block only.</br>
        4.We can cange the var and let variable after declaring , but can't change the const var after declaration</br>
        5.we can intialze Var & Let variable and later assign values to it. but for const var we have assign value at the time of initilization.
